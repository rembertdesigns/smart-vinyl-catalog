# Smart Vinyl Catalog & Recommendation Engine
## Kaggle BigQuery AI Challenge Submission

### Project Overview
An AI-powered vinyl collection management system that processes mixed-format data to generate personalized music recommendations and collection insights.

### Technical Architecture

#### Data Pipeline
- **Source Data**: Discogs releases, MARD reviews, personal collection exports
- **Storage**: BigQuery with 4 core tables
- **Processing**: BigQuery AI functions for text generation and extraction
- **Interface**: Streamlit dashboard with interactive analytics

#### Core Tables
1. `discogs_releases`: Album metadata and catalog information
2. `album_reviews`: Critical reviews and ratings from multiple sources  
3. `personal_collection`: Purchase history and personal ratings
4. `raw_collection_notes`: Unstructured notes for AI processing

#### AI Processing Workflow
1. **Extraction**: AI.GENERATE_TABLE structures messy collection notes
2. **Categorization**: ML.GENERATE_TEXT classifies albums by mood/context
3. **Recommendation**: AI.GENERATE creates personalized suggestions
4. **Analysis**: AI.FORECAST predicts collection growth patterns
